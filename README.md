###### My name is Shengling Tong, and I can also go by Charlie. I am a current master student at Columbia University. I'm originally from China but currently living in NYC. I'm currently looking for some full-time finance or economics related jobs around the United States, and research opportunities are also considered. Reach out to me if you share the same interest!
